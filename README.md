# Open-Source-Symphony
An open source composition of a symphony, written by the public for the public

# The Ground Rules
There is one main rule... Compose To Your Hearts Content!

# Format
The file is formatted as a MusicXML file. This was chosen to allow a wide range of platforms and make it easy for GitHub to keep track of versions of the score as they are checked in.

# How To Be Involved
1. Download a GitHub client onto your machine
2. Checkout the Open-Source-Symphony project
3. Import it into a MusicXML friendly composition environment (Finale, Sibilius, etc.)
4. Compose Away
5. Check in your changes and push the changes to the repository

# Forking
If at any point in time you would like to pull the piece in a vastly
different direction, or would like to take the piece and make your
own personal rendition, you are free to fork the project at any time.

# License
You can read the [License here](LICENSE). However, the gist of it is this: 
- There are no names attached to this composition
- Anyone can use, change, perform, this piece at will

Although the license does not require it, it would be great if performances
were recorded in the PERFORMANCES.md file along with Who, Date/Time, Place 
and Version of the piece.

# Abuses
Any check in that is deemed to be malicious or an intentional distruction
of the publics work will not be accepted as a pull request. However, even
total destruction or reconstruction could be understood as art and will be 
considered for branching.
